                        I am the master of HTML, CSS and Javascript. I know everything needed to make a website
                        function,
                        efficient. I didn't
                        stop with the web. I went beyond with most popular Javascript framework called Vue JS. I even
                        know
                        the deployment,
                        server and security. I will give you 100% web solution.

                <p>They didn't offer me a job. But I made myself as a remove web developer. I made their website and
                    showed it to them.
                    They liked it. And uploaded the content. It was fun working at Programming Hero.</p>
